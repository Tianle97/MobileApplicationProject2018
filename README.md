## *Introduction*
This is my 3rd year mobile application UWP project. <br/>
* UWP explain: <br/>
 Windows 10 introduces the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), which provides a common app platform on every device that runs Windows 10. The UWP provides a guaranteed core API across devices. New adaptive controls and layout panels help you to tailor your UI across a broad range of device screen resolutions and sizes, and respond to multiple kinds of device input. A unified app store makes your app available on Windows 10 devices such as PC, tablet, Xbox, HoloLens, Surface Hub, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. <br/>
 UWP is flexible. You can use languages such as C#, C++, Javascript, and VB. Have a C++ desktop app that you want to modernize with UWP features and sell in the Microsoft store? That's okay, too.
